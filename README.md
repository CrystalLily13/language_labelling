# What is this?
This is a script designed to make it easy to apply language labels to the songs that are being processed by whisper.

# How to use
clone the repository and run the command
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

This project requires VLC media player to be installed. If you get an error about libvlc.dll or libvlc.so reinstalling vlc media player should resolve this issue

---

you will then need to copy the audio folder with all of the songs into the project directory it should look like
```
language_labelling
├──audio (firectory with all of the songs)
├──main.py
└──(the other files in the repository)
```
---

Then the script can be launched with
```bash
python3 main.py
```
