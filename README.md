# What is this?
This is a script designed to make it easy to apply language labels to the songs that are being processed by whisper.

# How to use
clone the repository and run the command
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
you will then need to copy the audio folder with all of the songs into the project directory

Then the script cana be launched with
```python3 main.py```

someone who is better at communicating than me should really update this, just contact me at @crystallily on discord if you want to help out with this
